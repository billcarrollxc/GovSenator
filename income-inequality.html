	<h2>Income Inequality (Pay Gap)</h2>
<p>For the past several years, income inequality has been a hot topic in American politics.  The debate is well justified.  After all, the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Datebook found in 2014 that 74.6% of all wealth in the United States is owned by 10% of the people (146).  Moreover, the size of the middle class, long regarded as an indicator of the health of the economy (Source), has shrunk from 62% of the U.S. population in 1970 to 43% in 2014 (Pew Social Trends).</p>

<p>Such statistics are mind-blowing, and progressive politicians have capitalized on the American public's outrage.  The outrage usually stems from moderates reading left-wing biased media and taking the situation upon themselves to become the next Mother Teresa.  Those "inspired" people in prominent positions then try to change the world to "help the homeless."  The problem comes when teachers try to bring politics into the classroom and take it upon themselves to foist their views upon their students, effectively turning schools into a liberal breeding combine.  While such a situation is an annoyance at best to those raised in a conservative household, it is extremely damaging to students with little background in politics and few political views of their own.  The teacher shows students a graph of income growth in the United States resembling a hockey stick (Figure 1), and the students become transformed from <em>tabula rasa</em> learners to "stark raving mad" liberal progressives.</p>

	<p>As usual, statistics are not always what they seem to be.  As Thomas Sowell notes, the top one percent of income is especially "transient."  He continues, writing that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found that "more than half the people who were in the top one percent in 1996, were no longer there in 2005."  If the upper one percent of income is $465,626 or higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, people could living in a large city could sell a home and easily land in the ranks of the fabled upper one percent.  If this is true, some might question, what about next year?  One cannot keep selling a home every year.  Well, as we already noted, the ranks of the upper one percent are notoriously fickle.  In sum, part of the growing income of the rich can be attributed to external factors, such as rising house prices (Remember the housing bubble in the mid 2000s?) and not robber barons, who died over a century ago.</p>
	
	<p>Though the income growth inequality is not as big a problem as it might seem, the situation is far from ideal.  So how can we fix this?  Capitalism is the only system that has consistently and systematically worked.  Sources vary, but capitalism originated sometime in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the decline of the feudal system (a precursor of socialism?).  Data are hard to come by that early in history, but much of the world would be living in poverty.

	Such a radical decline can only be attributed to changing economies and social structures.  Even with marked decreases, an enormous amount of people in the United States were and are still living in poverty.  Figure 3 shows that in 1950, thirty-five percent of the country was impoverished.  After World War II, the government rolled back economic regulations allowed capitalism to work its magic.  From 1951 to 1960, the poverty rate in America dropped <em>fifteen percent</em>.

	And then what happens?  In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson inaugurates his Great Society policy, a Keynesian program designed to pour millions of dollars into welfare and other relief programs in a mission to eradicate poverty.  What could go wrong when the federal government comes to the rescue?  A lot, it seems.  Since then, poverty decline has largely stagnated, speeding up during good economies and slowing down during bad times.  But waiting decades, if not centuries, for an economic system to work is not an attractive option for someone who read the latest Washington Post op-ed.  They would suggest doing what LBJ already tried, heavily taxing the rich and giving to the poor because "it's just not fair."</p>
	
	<p>As misguided individuals commonly invoke pathos in their arguments, it is often helpful to respond in kind.  Reasoning with these people first involves looking at the distinction between justly and unjustly earned wealth.</p>
	
	<h4>Just vs. Unjust Wealth</h4>
	<p>Those who gain their wealth by unjust means "(e.g., by stealing it or committing fraud, etc.)" do not deserve to keep their wealth (Pratt).  Balancing the scales of justice would require a return of wealth to those whom it has been stolen from.  By the same token, those who gain their wealth by just means "(e.g., by providing services that the consumer likes and values more than the money they exchange for it)" do deserve to keep it (Pratt); for someone to take their wealth and reallocate it to the poor would be an injustice.  In fact, those who were given the just man's wealth would be in possession of unjust wealth as it was unfairly taken.  Dennis Pratt illustrates some examples:</p>
	<pre>Stealing -> Unjust
Donald strong-arms bananas from those who climb up and bring them down from the trees. So effective is he, that he accumulates X% of all the bananas harvested. Donald’s method of wealth accumulation is unjust and unethical. It would be just to confiscate Donald’s ill-gotten bananas and return it to those from whom he stole them.
Trading -> Just
Fred consensually exchanges bananas for coconuts. His customers love the coconuts, which are very hard to gather. So good is he at this service, that Fred accumulates Y% of all the bananas. But his customers are pleased with the exchange, as is Fred. They continue to trade, even though Fred already has lots of bananas. Each exchange is win-win, in which both Fred and his customer come away wealthier. There is nothing unjust or unethical in what Fred is doing. It would be unjust to take Fred’s bananas.
Ganging Up -> Unjust
David envies Fred. David is very upset about banana inequality. David wants some of Fred’s bananas. David doesn’t figure out how to satisfy customers like Fred did; instead he plots against Fred. David rallies a gang to steal Fred’s bananas. David’s method is unjust and unethical. It would be just to confiscate David’s ill-gotten bananas and give back to Fred.
Competing -> Just
Ted is inspired by Fred. “Consumers really like coconuts,” he concludes. Ted wants more bananas. Instead of stealing from Fred, though, Ted invests his own bananas to plant coconut trees in an area more easily harvested. Ted eventually is trading coconuts at a lower exchange rate. Fred’s percentage of bananas drop. Ted’s percentage of bananas increase. Customers are even more pleased, eating even more coconuts and bananas. There is nothing unjust or unethical in what Fred is doing, no matter what percentage of all the bananas his customers happily trade to him.
Voting -> Unjust
Donald is envious of Ted. Donald wants some of Ted’s bananas. Donald is very upset about banana inequality. Donald doesn’t figure out how to better satisfy customers like Ted did; instead he plots against Ted. He gets a bunch of his buddies to vote to take Ted’s bananas and give the bananas to them. Ted’s method is unjust and unethical. It would be just to confiscate Ted’s ill-gotten bananas and give back to Ted.</pre>
	
	<h4><em>The Richest Man in Babylon</em> Solution</h4>
	<p>Those who have read The Richest Man in Babylon will be familiar with George S. Clason's solution to the income growth inequality problem: teach all people to become wealthy.  At its core, the idea makes sense and is probably the most attractive option to people who understand and espouse the benefits of a laissez-faire capitalistic economy.  However, many would argue that not all people have equal opportunities.  That may be so, but is incentivising people not to work and collect welfare checks any better?</p>
	
	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
	<p>Income inequality is an issue that has plagued America and the world for centuries.  A problem will not be fixed overnight.  There is a solution, but it takes time.  It is worth remembering, though, that taking from the rich and giving to the poor will never work.  Even if we disregard for a moment the injustice of that solution, it is impossible to effectively implement. The rich have better lawyers, accountants, and everyone that would allow them to find loopholes in the law, not to mention the support of legislators (Flannery). After all, whose donations fund the campaigns of those in public office?  Patience is a virtue. in the meantime, the best solution is helping people on a micro scale. Donate alms. Bring back tithing. And remember, always think rationally!</p>
