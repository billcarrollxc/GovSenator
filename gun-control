	<h2>Gun Control</h2>
  
<p>Every time there is a violent crime, scores of people commit themselves to eradicating guns from our society.  Congressmen, not wanting 
to be the ones who desecrate the memory of the victims of an attack, eagerly join the fray and quickly pass a laws restricting weapons.  
This is lunacy.  Does anyone really think that laws are going to stop criminals, who--by definition--are breaking laws anyways.  All these 
laws are doing is giving civilians a difficult time protecting themselves when under duress.  If you want to stop gun violence, try making 
it so that people are scared to commit violent acts because their potential victim might be armed.</p>
