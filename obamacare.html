	<h2>Obamacare</h2>
  
<p>State-run health-care sounds like a great idea in theory.  After all, insurance companies wonâ€™t be able to turn away people on the basis 
of preexisting conditions, and insurance will be forced to cover people who cannot afford it.  But why on earth is that a good idea?  Do 
people really believe that insurance companies are big evil giants that can somehow survive without making money.  The first principle of 
business is that in order to be successful, the costs of running the business must be smaller than the revenue.  When companies are forced 
to carry people for far more than they are able pay, they collapse.  To prevent collapse, insurance companies must then jack up premiums 
for everyone else.  The middle class suffers.  I propose re-privatizing health-care so people can get the type of coverage they need.</p>
