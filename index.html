	<p>William Carroll graduated from Westfield State University in 2022 with a B.S. in Athletic Training (AT) and a minor in Biology,
		while attaining Emergency Medical Services (EMS) certification.  Then, in January of 2023, he matriculated into WSU’s two-year
		Physician Assistant M.S. program.  Upon graduation, Carroll was co-opened a private sports clinic, where he worked for the next
		twenty-eight years.  Over  the course of his long employment, Carroll grew disillusioned with the problems of government,
		especially the federal government’s foray into state-run health-care, known as the Affordable Care Act.</p>

	<p>William is officially enrolled in the Libertarian Party.  His main goals for his senatorship are creating economic growth and
		lifting the burden on middle class families.  He knows that the way to do this is not by Keynesian economics or some 
		"tax the rich" ideal.  Carroll, brought into poliitics by the burden Obamacare imposed on middle class families, is 
		committed to improving life for his constituents, which means supply-side and Austrian cycle economics.  Read more about
		the Libertarian Party <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/libertarianism-politics" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
